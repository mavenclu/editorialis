# Journal Manuscript Preparation System  

A journal editorial board manages submission/publication process of journal articles.
Its members ask experts to read and review papers.
Each reviewer needs to be informed (e.g. by email) about a new paper assigned to him/her to review.
He/she downloads the paper, prepares a review and writes notes into a single large text area or uploads a self-prepared PDF file.
Editorial board, as well as authors want to know, which articles are already reviewed and which are under review.
